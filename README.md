# Why

The other day I felt the need to display small icons on an OLED display.

And I didn't wanted to go the full way (GIF/JPEG/PNG) but use a simple format. So this bmp routine came to life.

It is limited to 8-bit-BMPs and has some size contrains (easily removable), but it should be a good starting point.

# Benefits

* simple
* low code size
